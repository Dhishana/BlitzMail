BlitzMail
=========
Share content via email with just one click!

BlitzMail is an Android app that allows you to set up your email account once and then use it to send emails to an address of your choice. This comes in handy when you need to send a lot of things via email, because you are in a low connectivity area (e.g. subway) and want to remember things to look at later.
